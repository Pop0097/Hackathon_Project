# LassoLearn

A revolutionary platform for users to connect in one-on-one discussions to teach and/or learn new skills! Built using React JS and Firebase.

# Deploying the Project

1. Download and extract the zip file of this repository.
2. cd to the repository.
3. Type `cd yeehaw` and run `npm install` to download all required dependencies. 
4. Type `npm start` after the dependencies have downloaded and enjoy :))

NOTE: For the time being I have added "SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true" to the .env file becuase there was an issue between react-scripts and webpack that I could not resolve. I will look into it at a later date.
