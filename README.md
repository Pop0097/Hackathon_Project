# Yeehaw_Hacks

Project made for YeeHaw hacks in August 2020.

# Deploying the Project

1. Download and extract the zip file of this repository.
2. cd to the repository.
3. Type `cd yeehaw` and run npm install to download all required dependencies. In addition, download the following dependecies:
    - `npm i firebase`
    - `npm i react-router-dom`
3. Type npm start after the dependencies have downloaded and enjoy :))

NOTE: For the time being I have added "SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true" to the .env file becuase there was an issue between react-scripts and webpack that I could not resolve. I will look into it at a later date.
